# Robo‑Phlebotomist & Infusion Nurse

## Abstract

An autonomous robotic system for blood collection and IV fluid administration in SCD patients, utilizing gesture-guided cannulation, real-time vitals monitoring, and AI-supervised infusion protocols to provide safe, precise, and minimally invasive clinical care.

## Problem Statement

Sickle cell disease patients require frequent blood draws for monitoring and IV hydration during vaso-occlusive episodes. Traditional phlebotomy and IV insertion can be challenging due to difficult venous access, patient anxiety, and the need for repeated procedures. Healthcare staff shortages and the need for 24/7 monitoring compound these challenges.
