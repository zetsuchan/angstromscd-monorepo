# Vitals‑on‑Wheels Kiosk

## Abstract

A mobile robotic health screening kiosk that autonomously deploys to community locations to provide comprehensive vital sign monitoring, basic diagnostic testing, and FHIR-compliant data integration for SCD patients and broader community health screening initiatives.
