# Rehab & Physical‑Therapy Bot

## Abstract

An exertion-aware robotic exoskeleton system designed for SCD patients to safely perform prescribed mobility exercises with adaptive power assistance, real-time vitals monitoring, and AR-guided training to optimize rehabilitation outcomes while preventing overexertion-induced vaso-occlusive episodes.

## Problem Statement

Sickle cell disease patients face unique challenges in physical rehabilitation due to exercise-induced risks of triggering vaso-occlusive episodes. Traditional physical therapy lacks real-time physiological monitoring and adaptive assistance, leading to suboptimal outcomes and potential complications. Many patients avoid beneficial exercise due to fear of triggering crises.
