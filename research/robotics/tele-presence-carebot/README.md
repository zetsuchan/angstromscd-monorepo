# Tele‑Presence Carebot

## Abstract

A 5G-powered mobile robotic platform enabling remote clinical presence, allowing specialists to conduct virtual rounds in patients' homes or local clinics through advanced telepresence technology, robotic manipulation, and AR-guided caregiver assistance.

## Problem Statement

Sickle cell disease patients often lack access to specialized care due to geographic barriers, particularly in rural areas or resource-limited settings. Traditional telemedicine lacks the physical interaction capabilities needed for comprehensive clinical assessment and hands-on care guidance. Healthcare disparities are exacerbated by limited specialist availability and long travel requirements for patients.
