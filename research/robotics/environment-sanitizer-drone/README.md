# Environment‑Sanitizer Drone

## Abstract

An autonomous air-quality-responsive patrol drone equipped with HEPA filtration, UV-C sterilization, and targeted disinfection capabilities to maintain optimal environmental conditions for SCD patients by monitoring air quality, eliminating pathogens, and providing localized humidity control.

## Problem Statement

Sickle cell disease patients are particularly vulnerable to respiratory infections and environmental triggers that can precipitate vaso-occlusive episodes. Poor air quality, airborne pathogens, and inadequate humidity control in living spaces increase the risk of complications. Manual cleaning and air purification are labor-intensive and may miss critical areas or timing.
