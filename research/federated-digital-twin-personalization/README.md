# Federated Digital‑Twin Personalization for Rare‑Disease Remote Monitoring

## Abstract

This research addresses the challenge of building patient‑specific digital twins for rare disease monitoring under strict privacy constraints, leveraging federated meta‑learning to overcome data scarcity limitations inherent in sickle cell disease research.

## Problem Statement

Building patient‑specific 'digital twins' faces significant challenges when each medical center possesses limited SCD patient data (typically tens of patients). Traditional centralized approaches violate privacy regulations, while standard federated learning fails to achieve rapid personalization for new patients.

## Research Novelty

The proposed solution introduces a federated meta‑learning framework that:
- Learns a robust global initialization of digital‑twin models across multiple hospitals
- Enables rapid fine‑tuning on individual patient data with minimal samples
- Maintains strict privacy preservation through differential privacy mechanisms
- Operates on standard FHIR/LIS time‑series data formats

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Federated Meta‑Learning Foundation
- Implement Model‑Agnostic Meta‑Learning (MAML) across federated nodes
- Each node maintains local FHIR/LIS time‑series datasets
- Develop privacy‑preserving gradient aggregation protocols

### Phase 2: Privacy‑Preserving Architecture
- Integrate differential privacy mechanisms for gradient sharing
- Implement secure aggregation protocols for model updates
- Design noise injection strategies that preserve learning efficiency

### Phase 3: Multi‑Center Validation
- Deploy across 5 different SCD treatment centers
- Evaluate personalization speed and accuracy metrics
- Compare against standard federated averaging baselines

### Phase 4: Few‑Shot Adaptation
- Optimize meta‑learning initialization for rapid patient‑specific adaptation
- Develop transfer learning strategies for cross‑patient knowledge sharing
- Implement online learning capabilities for continuous model refinement

## Expected Impact

Performance improvements over baseline approaches:
- **2× faster** personalization convergence
- **15% better** predictive performance compared to federated averaging
- Maintains privacy compliance across all participating centers
- Enables practical deployment in resource‑constrained clinical environments

## Applications

- Cross‑hospital SCD patient monitoring
- Rapid onboarding of new patients to monitoring systems
- Privacy‑compliant research collaboration
- Personalized treatment optimization
- Real‑world evidence generation for rare diseases

## Regulatory Considerations

- HIPAA compliance through differential privacy
- GDPR‑compatible federated architecture
- IRB approval pathways for multi‑center studies
- Clinical validation requirements for digital twin deployment
