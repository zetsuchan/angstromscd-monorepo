# Graph‑Neural Modeling of Care‑Circle Influence Networks for Early Crisis Warning

## Abstract

This research develops a dynamic graph neural network approach that integrates individual patient sensor data with social support network signals to enhance early crisis prediction in sickle cell disease monitoring through peer influence modeling.

## Problem Statement

Current remote patient monitoring systems operate in isolation, focusing solely on individual patient data while ignoring valuable social support signals. Peer stress events, mentor relationships, and care‑circle dynamics provide crucial contextual information that could significantly improve crisis prediction accuracy and intervention timing.

## Research Novelty

The proposed solution introduces a dynamic GNN architecture that:
- Integrates personal sensor graphs with care‑circle adjacency networks
- Propagates stress signals through social support networks
- Models temporal influence decay and peer correlation patterns
- Leverages collective intelligence for improved individual predictions

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Multiplex Graph Construction
- Build patient‑centric multiplex graphs where nodes represent individual patients
- Define edge types for different relationship categories:
  - Care‑circle links (family, friends, caregivers)
  - Mentor‑mentee relationships (peer support programs)
  - Clinical care team connections
  - Geographic proximity relationships

### Phase 2: Multi‑Modal Node Features
- Encode time‑series sensor data as node feature embeddings
- Integrate physiological signals (SpO₂, heart rate, activity levels)
- Include patient‑reported outcomes (pain scores, mood, medication adherence)
- Incorporate environmental factors (weather, barometric pressure, location)

### Phase 3: Temporal GNN Architecture
- Implement dynamic graph convolution layers with temporal attention
- Design influence‑decay mechanisms to model time‑dependent peer effects
- Develop message passing protocols that respect privacy constraints
- Create hierarchical aggregation for multi‑scale relationship modeling

### Phase 4: Stress Signal Propagation
- Model how stress events propagate through care networks
- Implement attention mechanisms for selective influence modeling
- Design adaptive weighting based on relationship strength and history
- Incorporate intervention feedback to refine influence models

## Expected Impact

Performance improvements over individual‑only monitoring:
- **10% lift** in early‑warning precision through peer signal integration
- Enhanced prediction capabilities during simultaneous stress events
- Improved understanding of social determinants of health outcomes
- More effective care‑circle engagement strategies

## Applications

- Community‑based health monitoring systems
- Peer support program optimization
- Family‑centered care coordination
- Social intervention targeting
- Population health management

## Network Architecture Components

### Graph Types
- **Personal Sensor Graph**: Individual patient's multi‑modal sensor network
- **Care‑Circle Graph**: Social support and family relationship network
- **Clinical Network**: Healthcare provider and care team connections
- **Geographic Graph**: Location‑based proximity and environmental sharing

### Node Types
- **Primary Patients**: Individuals with active SCD monitoring
- **Care‑Circle Members**: Family, friends, and informal caregivers
- **Healthcare Providers**: Doctors, nurses, social workers
- **Environmental Nodes**: Weather stations, air quality sensors

### Edge Features
- Relationship strength and duration
- Communication frequency and patterns
- Geographic distance and interaction history
- Clinical care coordination indicators

## Privacy and Ethical Considerations

### Data Protection
- Implement differential privacy for cross‑patient signal sharing
- Design consent mechanisms for network participation
- Ensure HIPAA compliance in peer data integration
- Develop opt‑out protocols that maintain network integrity

### Social Dynamics
- Address potential bias in peer influence modeling
- Consider cultural factors in care‑circle relationship interpretation
- Implement fairness constraints across diverse communities
- Design systems that strengthen rather than strain social relationships

## Validation Strategy

### Retrospective Analysis
- Analyze historical crisis events for peer correlation patterns
- Validate influence propagation models against known outcomes
- Assess improvement in prediction accuracy with network features

### Prospective Studies
- Deploy in controlled care‑circle pilot programs
- Compare individual vs. network‑enhanced prediction performance
- Measure impact on care‑circle engagement and support quality

### Cross‑Community Validation
- Test generalizability across different demographic groups
- Evaluate performance in urban vs. rural care networks
- Assess cultural adaptability of relationship modeling

## Technical Requirements

- Real‑time graph processing capabilities
- Scalable to networks of 1000+ patients with 5000+ care‑circle members
- Privacy‑preserving computation protocols
- Integration with existing patient monitoring infrastructure
- Mobile‑friendly interfaces for care‑circle member participation
