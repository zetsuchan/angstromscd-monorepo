# Spatio‑Temporal Hypoxia Risk Modeling via Multi‑Modal Transformer Fusion

## Abstract

This research focuses on developing a novel Transformer‑based architecture for early prediction of vaso‑occlusive episodes (VOE) in sickle cell disease patients through multi‑modal sensor fusion.

## Problem Statement

Early prediction of vaso‑occlusive episodes (VOE) from asynchronously sampled barometric, SpO₂, heart‑rate, and pain‑score streams represents a critical challenge in SCD patient monitoring. Current approaches fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous sensor data with varying temporal characteristics.

## Research Novelty

The proposed solution introduces a Transformer‑based architecture that jointly embeds:
- GPS‑derived elevation data
- Barometer drift measurements  
- Wearable vitals (SpO₂, heart rate)
- User‑reported symptom scores

Key innovation: A learnable temporal attention mask that intelligently down‑weights stale sensor readings based on data freshness and reliability.

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Multi‑Modal Pre‑training
- Develop specialized encoders for each data modality:
  - Baro‑encoder for atmospheric pressure data
  - Vitals‑encoder for physiological measurements
  - Spatial‑encoder for GPS/elevation features
  - Symptom‑encoder for pain scores

### Phase 2: Cross‑Modal Fusion
- Implement cross‑attention layers respecting natural sampling rates
- Design adaptive fusion mechanisms for asynchronous data streams
- Integrate temporal decay functions for missing data handling

### Phase 3: Temporal Attention Masking
- Develop learnable attention masks based on data age
- Implement time‑decay gates for graceful degradation
- Optimize attention weights for predictive accuracy

## Expected Impact

Performance improvements over baseline models:
- **20% reduction** in false alarm rates
- **30% improvement** in prediction lead time
- Superior performance compared to RNN/GNN baselines

## Applications

- Real‑time VOE risk assessment
- Personalized alert systems
- Clinical decision support tools
- Remote patient monitoring optimization
