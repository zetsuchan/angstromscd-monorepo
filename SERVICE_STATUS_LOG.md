| Service | Port | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| PostgreSQL with pgvector | 5432 | ‚úÖ Stopped (was working) | Database initialized with SCD tables |
| ChromaDB | 8000 | ‚úÖ Stopped (was working) | Vector database for embeddings |
| Qdrant | 6333 | ‚úÖ Stopped (was working) | Alternative vector database |

### üü° Application Services
| Service | Port | Status | Issues Resolved |
|---------|------|--------|-----------------|

## Issues Encountered & Fixed

### 1. File Corruptions
- **baml-service.ts**: Had "main" keywords corrupting the file
- **tracing.ts**: Had syntax errors with "main" on line 20
- **package.json (vector)**: Had corrupted scripts section

### 2. Missing Configuration
- **API package.json**: Missing "dev" script, added `"dev": "bun run --hot src/index.ts"`

### 3. Import Naming Issues
- Changed `testAppleFoundationConnection` to `testAppleBridgeConnection` throughout codebase

### 4. Directory Issues
- Services were initially started from wrong directory (/infra instead of root)

## Database Status
- **Tables Created**: 
  - `scd_patients` - Patient data
  - `voe_episodes` - Vaso-occlusive episodes
  - `literature_citations` - Medical literature references
- **Vector Collections**: Ready for medical paper embeddings

## Environment Configuration
- ‚úÖ All .env files created from examples
- ‚úÖ Database connections configured
- ‚úÖ Service URLs properly set
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API keys need to be added for:
  - OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  - Anthropic (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

## To Restart Everything

From root directory:
```bash
# Start infrastructure
cd infra && docker-compose up -d && cd ..

# Start all services
bun run dev
```

## Next Steps
1. Add API keys to .env files for AI functionality
2. Access frontend at http://localhost:5173
3. Test medical query functionality
4. Monitor logs for any runtime issues

## Working Features
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity
- ‚úÖ Vector database integration
- ‚úÖ Service discovery between components
- ‚úÖ Hot reloading for development
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration
- ‚úÖ Local AI model support (Ollama)
- ‚úÖ Apple Foundation Models support

## Not Yet Tested
- Medical query processing
- Literature search functionality
- VOE risk assessment
- Real AI model integration (requires API keys)
