# BAML Integration Summary

## Changes Made to Enable BAML Pipelines

### 1. Enabled BAML Tool Detection
- **File**: `apps/api/src/services/enhanced-chat-service.ts`
- **Change**: Uncommented the BAML tool detection code (lines 225-290)
- **Added**: 
  - Console logging for debugging BAML calls
  - Proper error handling with fallback to direct model calls
  - Support for both cloud and local (Ollama) models

### 2. Added Meditron Support to BAML
- **File**: `packages/baml/baml_src/clients.baml`
- **Added**: `OllamaMeditronLatest` client configuration for `meditron:latest` model

### 3. Created Unified Medical Chat Function
- **File**: `packages/baml/baml_src/medical_chat.baml` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - `MedicalChat` function for cloud models (GPT-4, Claude)
  - `MedicalChatOllama` function for local models (Meditron, Llama, etc.)
  - Structured response with medical context, suggestions, and tool requirements
  - Proper handling of SCD-specific medical queries

### 4. Integrated BAML for All Model Calls
- **File**: `apps/api/src/services/enhanced-chat-service.ts`
- **Change**: Replaced direct `callMeditron` with BAML `MedicalChat`/`MedicalChatOllama`
- **Benefits**:
  - All responses now go through BAML's structured pipeline
  - Better medical context handling
  - Consistent response format across all models

### 5. Updated Tool Detection Client
- **File**: `packages/baml/baml_src/tools.baml`
- **Change**: Updated `DetermineToolUsageOllama` to use `OllamaMeditronLatest` client

## How BAML Integration Works Now

1. **User sends a message** → Frontend posts to `/api/chat`

2. **API processes with BAML**:
   - First calls `DetermineToolUsage`/`DetermineToolUsageOllama` to detect if tools are needed
   - If visualization needed → Executes E2B code interpreter
   - If medical literature needed → Triggers PubMed search
   - Then calls `MedicalChat`/`MedicalChatOllama` for the final response

3. **BAML provides structured responses** with:
   - Main message content
   - Medical context and considerations
   - Follow-up suggestions
   - Tool execution results (visualizations, citations)

## Testing the Integration

Run the test script to verify BAML is working:
```bash
node test-baml-integration.js
```

Check API logs for BAML-related messages:
- "Using BAML tool detection for model:"
- "BAML tool analysis result:"
- "Calling BAML MedicalChat with model:"
- "BAML MedicalChat response:"

## Environment Requirements

Make sure these are set in your `.env` files:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT models
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude models
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` - Default: `http://localhost:11434/v1`

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all services are running:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. Test with different queries:
   - Visualization: "Create a chart showing VOE frequency"
   - Literature: "Latest SCD treatments for children"
   - General: "Explain hydroxyurea dosing"

3. Monitor logs to confirm BAML pipelines are being called

The BAML integration is now complete and should route all chat requests through structured AI pipelines!
